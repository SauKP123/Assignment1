"""
Takes two numbers as input from the user- a,b
Perform the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers
Addition = a + b
Subtraction = a - b
Multiplication = a * b
Division = a / b
"""

a = int(input("Enter first number: "))
b = int(input("Enter second number: "))
Addition = a + b
subtraction = a - b
multiplication = a * b
division = a / b
print("Addition: ", Addition)
print("Subtraction: ", subtraction)
print("Multiplication: ", multiplication)
